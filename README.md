# Ecom Scraper

Ecom Scraper is a Python project that scrapes product details from e-commerce websites like Amazon, Cartlow, Noon, Popsy, Northladder, Revent, and Revibe.
It allows you to extract product information such as title, price, rating, and description, and store it in a structured format for further analysis.
